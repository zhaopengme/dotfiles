# Secrets manifest for the private dotfiles overlay
#
# After running `git secret reveal`, decrypted files will appear in this directory.
# This manifest maps each decrypted filename to the final destination path on disk.
#
# Format (simple "key: value"):
#   <decrypted_filename>: "<absolute_or_tilde_path>"
#
# Notes:
# - Keep paths quoted.
# - Use "~" for home when convenient.
# - Destination directories will be created if missing.
# - Destination files will be copied (not symlinked) and chmod 600 will be applied.

# --- SSH ---
# Example: store an encrypted SSH config as `ssh_config.secret`
# After reveal, you will get a decrypted file named `ssh_config`, which will be installed to ~/.ssh/config
# ssh_config: "~/.ssh/config"

# Optional: known_hosts (only if you really want to manage it this way)
# known_hosts: "~/.ssh/known_hosts"

# --- Tokens / Credentials (examples) ---
# Example: `tokens.env.secret` -> decrypted `tokens.env` -> installed to a private config directory
# tokens.env: "~/.config/private/tokens.env"

# Example: npm config (be careful with auth tokens)
# npmrc: "~/.npmrc"

# Example: GitHub CLI auth (consider using keychain instead)
# gh_hosts: "~/.config/gh/hosts.yml"

# --- Tooling configs (examples) ---
# Example: AWS config/credentials (often better managed via SSO, but supported if needed)
# aws_config: "~/.aws/config"
# aws_credentials: "~/.aws/credentials"

# --- Examples (uncomment what you actually use) ---
#
# SSH config (recommended to keep this non-secret if possible)
# ssh_config: "~/.ssh/config"
#
# Authorized keys (server-side)
# authorized_keys: "~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
#
# App tokens / configs
# tokens.env: "~/.config/private/tokens.env"
# gh_hosts: "~/.config/gh/hosts.yml"
